# JARVIS README

Jarvis assists developers with day-to-day activities like finding out time complexity of their program in big O notation, explaining the code to them, helping them in translating from one coding language to another in a snap of fingers, fixing their buggy code, getting the auto generated documentation or commenting of their code, etc. The user statements/commands are analyzed with the help of Artificial Intelligence to give an optimal solution. 
## Features

1.	Explain Code: 
Reading Code is hard, then understanding it makes it more difficult. The Explain Code feature of Jarvis explains to them what their code actually does in plain English

2.	Generate Code
Imagine having a project that needs to be done in a short time or it’s deadline is coming closer, that would be a nightmare for anyone but this might be a good dream with the help of Jarvis if most of the work could be done using this.
Using natural language processing and artificial intelligence, Jarvis takes a description of your problem as an input and generates actual code that solves these problems.

3.	Language Translator
As the name suggest, this feature is used to translate code from one programming language to another. 
Let’s say there’s a programmer who works on JavaScript and now wants the python alternative of the same program. All he got to do is copy his JavaScript code and select the language he wants it to be translated in and click on the translate button and boom the magic happens, his code is now translated from JavaScript to Python in just a snap of fingers.

4.	Time Complexity

Measure the efficiency of your code in Big O notation using the Time Complexity function and see how you can optimize your program using the Time Complexity feature of Jarvis.

5.	Generate Documentation:

Don't like writing documentation for your functions? Have Figstack's Docstring Writer craft detailed docstrings so your functions are always readable and maintable.

6.	Fix Errors-

Getting frustrated from never ending errors in your code? Jarvis will now help you in fixing the errors of your code as well. Just select your code and with a single click you’ll get the bug free code version of yours.
